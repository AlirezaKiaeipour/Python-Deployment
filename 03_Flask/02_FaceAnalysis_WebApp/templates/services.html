                            <p>Basal metabolic rate measures the calories needed to perform your body's most basic (basal) functions, like breathing, circulation, and cell production. BMR is most accurately measured in a lab setting under extremely restrictive conditions. Understanding basal metabolic rate (BMR) helps to determine the estimated baseline amount of calories your body needs to function and serves as a starting point to determine how many calories to consume based on your goals.</p>
